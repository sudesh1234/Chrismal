        <h4 class="sub">Grid Tie</h4>
          <p class="p1">
            There is nothing more beautiful than a sleek, flush mounted system on your roof telling people that you are doing your part for the next generation.
            In the past few years, the cost of solar has shot down drastically. What was once an option that could only be justified in terms of environmental impact is now a smart investment. 
            Once your solar system is installed, that monthly feeling of dread when the utility bill arrives will be gone. 
            Return on investment (ROI) is reduced even further by government subsidies and tax credits.

        <h4 class="sub">Hybrid</h4>
          <p class="p1">
            This class of grid-tie inverter allows for net-metering, but can also charge a battery backup system in case the utility grid fails. 
            You should install a grid-tied battery backup system when you want access to your local utility grid but have critical loads that need constant power, such as medical equipment.

        <h3 class="heading">Charge Controller</h3>
        <h4 class="sub">What is a charge controller?</h4>
          <p class="p1">
            A charge controller is a regulator that prevents batteries from overcharging. 
            Almost all battery based systems use charge controllers as they are a critical component to higher voltage PV arrays. 
            Charge controllers regulate the electric current that flows in and out from the battery bank, motor or pump. 
            By controlling the rate of electric current, charge controllers prevent overcharging and can protect against over-voltage which could damage the battery or motor. 
            A charge controller can also prevent totally draining ("deep discharging") a battery, or perform controlled discharges, depending on the battery technology, to protect battery life.
          </p>
        <h4 class="sub">MPPT and PWM: Which one Is For Me?</h4>
          <p class="p1">
            There are several different sizes and styles of charge controllers. You can drill down the one you need by reviewing the two main types of charge controllers, MPPT and PWM. 
            Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) charge controllers are the most basic charge controllers. These units regulate the flow of energy into the battery by turning "on" and "off". 
            This cycle will continue until the voltage charge set-point is reached and will proceed to trickle charge your battery. These types of charge controllers are popular for smaller, lower voltage systems. 
            (Example: 12V nominal solar panel charging a 12V battery bank.) When the input voltage from your PV array is close to that of your battery bank, 
            using a rudimentary charge controller will be a very cost effective way to charge your batteries safely. Keep in mind that if you want to use a higher voltage panel to charge your battery bank, 
            the "on"/ "off" function of the PWM style controller could reduce the life of your battery bank by charging it constantly with a significantly higher voltage. This is where MPPT charge controllers come in. 
            Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) charge controllers track the voltage curve as the sun moves along the sky using an algorithm to ensure that at any point during the day, you achieve maximum energy harvest. 
            As a rule of thumb, anytime your solar panel voltage is twice that of your battery bank, an MPPT charge controller is the best choice. While more expensive, 
            these units will consistently charge your battery bank to ensure the maximum charge rate (about 30% higher than PWM style charge controllers) without overcharging your batteries. 
            MPPT charge controllers also allow for larger and higher voltage solar arrays. Most PWM charge controllers reach a 60 amp maximum output and around 120V solar panel voltage input. 
            MPPT charge controllers can be up to 100 amps. MPPT charge controllers also come in higher voltage options like 150V, 200V, 250V, 300V and 600VDC configurations. 
            For example, if you need to mount your solar panels a few hundred feet away from your battery bank, looking into a higher voltage input MPPT charge controller will help you minimize wire sizing and voltage drop.
          </p>
        <h4 class="sub">How do I size my charge controller?</h4>
          <p class="p1">
            There are several factors that you need to consider when sizing your charge controller for your system. You can start by first determining your system voltage. 
            Will this be a 12V, 24V or a 48V system? If you are starting from scratch and need a gauge to help determine your system voltage, a good rule of thumb is: <br>
            12V systems - generally under 1200 wattsbr <br>
            24V systems - 1200 watts - 3000 watts <br>
            48V systems - above 3000 watts

        <h3 class="heading">Solar Pannel Lights</h3>
        
          <p class="p1">
            Outdoor solar lighting systems use solar cells, which convert sunlight into electricity. 
            The electricity is stored in batteries for use at night. Manufacturers most commonly use nickel cadmium, sealed lead acid, 
            and lead acid batteries. Outdoor solar lighting systems work well in most areas of the United States.

        <h3 class="heading">Solar Attic Fans</h3>
        <h4 class="sub">What are the benefits?</h4>
          <p class="p1">
            By investing in a Solar Attic Fan, you will save on your electricity bill by reducing air conditioner workload, 
            prevent moisture buildup in your attic (ie. mold), and increase the lifetime of your roof. Plus, 
            because these fans are solar operated they are easily installed and don't even need to be tied into your existing electrical grid.
          </p>
        <h4 class="sub">With a Solar Attic Fan you will:</h4>
        <h5 class="sub1">Reduce Your Electricity Bill</h5>
          <p class="p1">
            Attic temperatures can exceed 160F during hot summer days. Using appropriate attic ventilation can reduce those temperatures by up to 50F. 
            Regardless of how much insulation is in the attic, heat can still transfer into local living spaces. 
            As solar attic fans expel heat, the work load of the air conditioning system is reduced, which conserves energy and increases your air conditioner's life span.
          </p>

        <h5 class="sub1">Prevent Moisture Build Up</h5>
          <p class="p1">
            Unwanted moisture can seep into the attic through ceiling light fixtures, bathroom exhaust fans, 
            and other possible leaks and cracks in the ceiling. Moisture condensing on the framing members and the inside of the roof deck can cause mold, 
            mildew and rot to grow in the roof deck and framing. Proper ventilation with a solar attic fan will reduce moisture build up and can help prevent these problems.
          </p>
          
        <h5 class="sub1">Increase the Lifetime of Your Roof</h5>
          <p class="p1">
            Although asphalt shingles are manufactured to endure abuse from the sun for several years, 
            an overheated, under ventilated attic exposes them to preventable heat and damage. 
            Your attic temperatures will be reduced with a solar attic fan thereby increasing the lifespan of your roof. <br><br>

            Solar powered attic fans do their job better than conventional, electrically powered fans. 
            They use no extra energy; in fact they use the same solar energy that heats the house to keep the house cooler. 
            Their electric motors are virtually silent and they need no extra wiring, and no additional circuit breakers for installation. 
            Since they are not connected to your homes electric power system, a licensed electrician is not needed for installation. 
            There are no hidden costs with installation or during operation.

          <p class="p1">
            <b>Adding battery backup to your grid-tied solar system.</b> 
            AC Coupling uses your existing system to feed power into a battery based inverter/charger to charge the battery bank.
            To do this, a standard Grid Tie inverter is used to turn the high voltage DC from the Solar Panels into AC Electricity.
            AC Coupling is highly efficient for “Self Consuming” Solar Power.

          <h3 class="heading">Solar LED Lights</h3>
            LED lights are the most efficient lighting technology on the market today. 
            While they are more expensive than fluorescent bulbs, they are also more energy efficient and can last more than 20 years. 
            Best of all, LED light bulbs are mercury free.
          <h4 class="sub">Candelabra LED Light Bulbs</h4>
            <p class="p1">
              These decorative bulbs are perfect for use in chandeliers, decorative lamps, vanity lights, and anywhere else that your light bulbs will be seen. 
              Because they are LEDs, they are significantly more efficient than traditional candelabra bulbs and use a fraction of the energy to emit the same beautiful white light.
            </p>
          <h4 class="sub">MR16 LED Lights</h4>
            <p class="p1">
              These lights have a wide variety of applications, from track lighting to display lighting to desk lamps. 
              They specialize in low intensity directional lighting. Traditional Halogen MR16 lights run at such high temperatures that they can be a fire risk. 
              Our MR16 LED light bulbs solve this issue (they do not generate heat) while still maintaining the low cost lighting that LEDs are known for.
